To use CI Fuzz and its dependencies you first must be able to access the CI repository.
For this, add the following repository settings to npm, e.g. in your ~/.npmrc file.

    //gitlab.code-intelligence.com/api/v4/projects/89/packages/npm/:_authToken="<YOUR_TOKEN>"

You can access your username and private token on the CI Download Portal Configuration page at https://downloads.code-intelligence.com/client.

To use the CI repository in your project, add it to the .npmrc project file:

    @jazzer.js:registry=https://gitlab.code-intelligence.com/api/v4/projects/89/packages/npm/

To enable fuzz testing in your project, add a dev-dependency to @jazzer.js/jest-runner
to your project. To do so, execute the following command:

    # if you use npm
    npm install --save-dev @jazzer.js/jest-runner@3.0.0

    # or if you use yarn
    yarn add --dev @jazzer.js/jest-runner@3.0.0

To integrate with your existing Jest setup, please add this to your
'jest.config.js':

    module.exports = {
      projects: [
        {
          displayName: "test",
        },
        {
          testRunner: "@jazzer.js/jest-runner",
          displayName: {
            name: "Jazzer.js",
            color: "cyan",
          },
          testMatch: ["<rootDir>/**/*.fuzz.js"],
        },
      ],
    };
