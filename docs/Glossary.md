# Glossary
To make sure we are talking about the same things we rely on the 
following definitions:

## Fuzzer aka Fuzzing Engine
Is a piece of software that generates input to feed into the system 
under test (SUT) via the fuzz tests. A coverage guided fuzzer will 
also collect information about the covered code during the execution 
and will try to improve coverage by adjusting the inputs accordingly.

## Fuzz Test 
Usually a function that takes an array of bytes from the fuzzer and 
calls functions from the system under test.

## Fuzzing 
Fuzzing describes the act of running the fuzzer against a fuzz test.

## Corpus
A set of useful test inputs

### Seed Corpus
A small corpus usually provided by the user. Findings can be added to 
this corpus for use in regression tests.

### Generated Corpus
The generated corpus contains interesting inputs found by the fuzzer 
while running the fuzz test.

## Replayer
A replayer runs inputs from the seed corpus against the fuzz test 
without generating new input. It can be used for debugging and/or 
regression testing.

## Sanitizer
Santizers use code instrumentation to detect bugs during the execution 
of an application. 

## Finding
A finding describes a bug or vulnerability found by the fuzzer and 
includes the input that causes it.

## Metrics
While using **cifuzz** you will get in touch with metrics descriping 
the progress or outcome of a fuzzing run. Some of them might have 
different meanings depending on the context, previous knowledge or 
might even be used differently by the various fuzzing engines. 
To avoid confusion we provide the following definitions:

### exec/s
The average number of times per second the fuzz target has been called
with a generated input since fuzzing started. 

### paths
While the fuzzer feeds generated inputs to a fuzz test, it progressively 
explores the code under test. 
The "paths" metric captures the different kinds of progress the fuzzer 
can make, such as

* reaching new lines of code;
* executing a loop body a different number of times;
* satisfying equality for larger parts of a failing comparison.

While this number increasing can be taken as a sign that the fuzzer is 
still making progress, it is not meaningful to compare across 
different fuzz tests.

For the libFuzzer engine, the "paths" metric coincides with the 
engine's "ft" (feature) count.

### last new path
The time that has passed since the last increase of the "paths" metric.

If this number keeps increasing, it is likely that the fuzzer isn't 
making progress anymore. In this case, use `cifuzz coverage` to 
get an idea of where the fuzzer got stuck.

## Coverage
Coverage describes the code reached (and therefore executed) during an 
application/fuzzing run. It can be measured in different categories, 
for example:

* Lines
* Functions
* Branches
