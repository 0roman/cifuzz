# cifuzz Gradle example
This is a simple Gradle based project, already configured with
**cifuzz**. It should quickly produce a finding, but slow enough to
see the progress of the fuzzer.

To start make sure you installed **cifuzz** according to the
main [README](../../README.md).

You can start fuzzing with
```bash
cifuzz run com.example.FuzzTestCase
```
