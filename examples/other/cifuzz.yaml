## Configuration for a CI Fuzz project
## Generated on 2022-06-14

## The build system used to build this project. If set to "auto" (the
## default), cifuzz tries to detect the build system automatically.
## Valid values: "auto", "cmake", "other".
#build-system: auto

# The build command executed by cifuzz to build a fuzz test. The
# $FUZZ_TEST environment variable is set by cifuzz when it executes the
# build command, which allows us to use a generic build command which
# builds only the specified fuzz test and its dependencies.
#
# The 'make clean' is important here to ensure that subsequent builds,
# which might use other build flags, produce new executables.
build-command: make clean && make $FUZZ_TEST
